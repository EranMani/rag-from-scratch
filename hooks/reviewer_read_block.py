"""
reviewer_read_block.py — hard block on Read/Glob/Grep calls from reviewer agents.

Registered as PreToolUse hook on Read, Glob, and Grep tools.

Reviewers (viktor, sage, quinn, mira, ryan) receive all necessary context
inline in their invocation prompt. They have no legitimate reason to make
file-system reads. Allowing reads lets them silently bypass the context
package discipline and run up token costs by reading the entire codebase.

Exception: ryan may Read LEARNING_LOG.md only. The Edit tool requires a prior
Read of the target file; Ryan's sole job is to append entries to LEARNING_LOG.md.

Agent identity is read from hooks/tool_cap.json (set by tool_cap_start.py).
If no agent session is active (active=false), allow through — the orchestrator
reads files freely.

Fail-open: any I/O or parse error → exit 0. Never block due to hook internals.
